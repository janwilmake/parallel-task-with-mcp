TBD also wait for a good MCP idea:

Research a good private data MCP with API key, not with oauth (yet).

Private company data MCPs: CRM like Salesforce

- Research email MCP
- Research Slack

Also, try to understand when this would be useful. Would it ever be? The thing is: an API key is too hard to set up for end users, and if you want to build a product with it, it requires auth/monetization. For this reason, a CRM like salesforce is great, but i think it's still

Goal: Showcase how a task can be done that uses an MCP. This week.

With DeepWiki it's already kinda accomplished. But gotta find a good one to
